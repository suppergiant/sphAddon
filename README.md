# sphAddon

## _An SPH addon for Blender_

This was created a CS graduate course final project in physical simulations.
- All software is free to use under the GNU General Public License.
- You can install the .zip of the finalProj folder as a regular addon in Blender.
- You can also watch the demo ~10 minutes [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kC7kKI56tCs)
- ✨I have also filled out the course survey for this class.✨
